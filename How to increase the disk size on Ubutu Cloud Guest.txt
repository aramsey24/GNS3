
The default Virtual disk size in Ubuntu's cloud image is quite small: 2.2G. I was constantly running out of space in /dev/vda1 after installing Python packages/modules/libs/files. 

This is the procedure I used in GNS3 VM (Workstation Pro) to resize the virtual disk size: 

in Workstation Pro go to the Shell Command/Console
cd to opt/gns3/images/QEMU

 
Verify the virtual disk size before resizing: 

 qemu-img info <filename-amd64>.img

you should see somethig like: 

image: ubuntu-18.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 2.2G (2361393152 bytes)
disk size: 324M
cluster_size: 65536
Format specific information:
    compat: 0.10
    refcount bits: 16


you can  increase the size by a set amount, ( +5G ) , or to a target size, ( 10G )
The actual size should not change much. 


$ qemu-img resize <filename-amd64>.img 10G
     Image resized.   >you should see this message



verify after resizing: 

you should see: 

$ qemu-img info ubuntu-18.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
image: ubuntu-18.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 10G (10737418240 bytes)
disk size: 324M
cluster_size: 65536
Format specific information:
    compat: 0.10
    refcount bits: 16


Note: since I didn't have to move the image to any other directory for KVM's use (in my case GNS3)I stopped after above procedures. In actual KVM you may have to move the file to somewhere like: /var/lib/libvirt/images

Powered up the image in GNS3, saw some errors about SSH keys. I also could not ssh into devices since it complained about missing ciphers offered by the router or switch. 
My issue was that the ciphers were missing in sshd_config file. 
so, go to /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and add the ciphers:
Ciphers aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc
